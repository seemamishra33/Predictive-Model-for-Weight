# Simple/Multiple Linear Regression Implementation 

## Project overview
This project is about modelling the linear relationshp between Height and Weight of Men and Women.


### Performance Mettrics to Evaluate Model
Two performance metrics

RMSE (Root Mean Square Value)
R2 Score

### Software information
Python libraries
Anaconda Python distribution. It comes with most of the standard Python libraries The basic Python libraries used:-

• Numpy – It provides a fast numerical array structure and operating functions.

• pandas – It provides tools for data storage, manipulation and analysis tasks.

• Scikit-Learn – The required machine learning library in Python.

• Matplotlib – It is the basic plotting library in Python. It provides tools for making plots.

• Seaborn - for plotting


## About the dataset

The data set has been imported from the Kaggle website with the following url:-

https://www.kaggle.com/mustafaali96/weight-height?select=weight-height.csv

The dataset contains the height and weight of 500 males and 500 females.


## Regression metrics for model performance


For regression problems, I have used two metrics to compute the model performance. They are RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-Squared Value.
